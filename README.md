#  Uber Traffic Analysis & Prediction - Internship project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical traffic data and builds predictive models to **forecast hourly traffic volume at road junctions**. The objective is to support ride-hailing platforms like **Uber** in optimizing routes, reducing congestion impact, and improving ETA accuracy.

---

## Objective

* Analyze traffic patterns across time and junctions
* Engineer time-based features
* Build and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models for traffic forecasting

---

## Approach

* Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Modeling

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
  * LSTM (Deep Learning)
* Evaluation Metrics**

  * MAE, MSE, R²

---

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow / Keras

---

## Key Insights

* Strong hourly and daily traffic patterns identified
* Ensemble and LSTM models outperform baseline regression
* Framework scalable for real-world traffic forecasting systems
